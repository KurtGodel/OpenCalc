I. SUPPORTED OPERATORS
Unary
	x!          factorial
	-x          inverse
Binary
    =           definition
	x==y        equality
	x*y         multiplication
	x+y         addition
	x-y         subtraction
	x/y         division
	x^y         power

II. DEFAULT FUNCTIONS
Unary
    sin(x)      sine
    cos(x)      cosine
    tan(x)      tangent
    ctn(x)      cotangent
    sec(x)      secant
    csc(x)      cosecant
    ln(x)       natural logarithm
    log(x)      logarithm base 10
    exp(x)      exponent
    sqrt(x)     square-root
    abs(x)      absolute vale
    floor(x)    floor
Other Predefined Functions
    C(x,y)
    rand()

III. PREDEFINED VARIABLES
    pi          3.141...
    e           2.718...
    phi         1.618...
    i           i
    last        last calculated value

IV. USER-DETERMINED NAMES
Variables names must begin with a string of letters. If a digit occurs, then every following character in that variables name must also be a digit.
    EX: x   quails   quails514
Function names must be a string of letters followed by an opening parantheses, a list of variables, and then a closing parantheses
    EX: f(x)    quails(x)   quails(x, y)
Note: If I define both x=3 and x(t)=t^2, then the calculator will recognize them as distinct entities.
